Prime Branson Location
Fantastic Branson location!! Tucked back in a nice neighborhood sits this spacious 3 bedroom home. You are close enough to walk to Grand Country or Dixie Stampede. This would be a perfect starter home or investment property to use for rental. Garage was converted into living space for extra elbow room! Take a look before this one is gone!
